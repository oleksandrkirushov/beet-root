                        <p>This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling. About twelve o'clock a
                            troop ofte or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track. The locomotive,
                            slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cowâ€“catcher; but the mass of animals
                            was too great.
                            The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening
                            bellowings.
                            There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can
                            moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could
                            contain.
                        </p>
                        <p>The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had
                            the
                            most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until
                            it
                            should please the buffaloes to get out of the way. <br>Passepartout was furious at the delay
                            they
                            occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.
                        </p>
                        <p>"What a country!" cried he. "Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as
                            if
                            they were not impeding travel! Parbleu! I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this
                            mishap in
                            his programme! And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd
                            of
                            beasts!"
                        </p>
                        <p class="last-p">The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.</p>
